# CVC Recode/Testing
This git repo is a portfolio project that is based off of Hypixel's Cops and Crims game. The point of this project is to recode the game mechanics in a way that makes the game more playable for new players with new bullet hit registration and various other mechanics to improve the game.

It is also a place to test new features that the community suggests. This way they can be tested and voted on to see if the rest of the community enjoys the idea.
